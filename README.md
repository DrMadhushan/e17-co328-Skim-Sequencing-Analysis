# Analysis Software for Next Generation Skim Sequencing

## Introduction

While DNA sequencing is an integral part of genetics research, there is a significant lack of fully-functional tools that provide easy access to DNA sequencing in a cost-effective manner. Our goal is to minimize the inefficiencies faced by professionals who conduct NGS for Chloroplast, Mitochondria and plant ITS regions by developing a complete solution that incorporates existing DNA sequencing pipelines into a single environment that is both intuitive and accessible.

## Project Objective
- To minimize the inefficiencies and problems faced by the researchers, while optimizing the processing time through multi-threading.
- Provide this combined functionality of each stage in the process of NGS, through a well-planned combination of pipelines.
- Provide an open source software with additional features such as receiving recommendations at each step of the pipeline.
- Provide a platform for users to carry out Skim sequencing without having to manually choose the tools with best performance.
- Provide  a single package with dependencies and resolve issues with different file formats.

## Proposed Solution
An open-source package that incorporates the existing ITS, Mitochondria and Chloroplast sequencing pipelines, and integrates them together to produce a complete toolkit.

## Process
1. Integrate the pipelines:   
The solution will contain a GUI environment that integrates all the necessary tools for the pipelines into a single space.

2. Automate the Workflow:   
The software will automate a lot of the intermediate steps while providing the user the relevant information and statistics for each step.

3. Provide Recommendations:   
The solution will attempt to provide suggestions to the user on possible next steps to take in case there are multiple possibilities.
